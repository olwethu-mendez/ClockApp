# ClockApp

This project is developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Basically it's an app/site to tell time, a stopwatch, and a countdown timer. It also has a background that updates based on the time of the day. The clock itself assumes the colour of the sun at daytime, and the colour of the moon at night.
This project is to help improve my understanding of CSS and JavaScript and to help me improve in them.
It isn't the most important thing though, so you don't need to waste time with it, though for me personally, it's a point of pride.
