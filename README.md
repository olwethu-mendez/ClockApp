# ClockApp

This project is developed with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Basically it's an app/site to tell time, a stopwatch, and a countdown timer.
This project is to help improve my understanding of CSS and JavaScript and to help me improve in them.
It isn't the most important thing though, so you don't need to waste time with it, though for me personally, it's a point of pride.
